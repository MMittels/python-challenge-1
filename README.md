# Python Challenge 1

## Overview
Python Challenge 1 was developed as an assignment from the University of Denver's Artificial Intelligence Bootcamp. The assignment specifically was to design an interactive ordering system from a food truck.

## Description
The python code, menu.py, can be utilized by food trucks as an interactive ordering systm. When the code is run it will first present main menu categories that can be selected by the user by typing in the corresponding number. Typing in a correponding number to the main menu categories will then present the detailed menu items that can be selected by the user. The code will then prompt for the quantity and ask if the user would like to order more items. Menu.py will either close out the order or continue to loop the ordering process as long as the user selects to continue to order. Once ordering is complete a copy of the receipt is displayed with each item ordered, the price, and quantity. All ordered items are summed to give a total price for the order.
